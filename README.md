This application is designed specifically for amateurs of the modern music industry, who are constantly tracking global trends, as well as for fans of all kinds of statistics.

To install, you should download the existing project in the repository (*clone or download*), where you need to run it in the working environment (Android Studio). Also, for the application to work properly, you need to **have a Spotify account and a Spotify application on your phone**.

It should be noted that the movement is carried out only by clicking: there are no components with data entry, which makes the use of the application as clear and comfortable.
